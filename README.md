This library takes care of cohercion, whether it's primitives or arrays, and
also provides a fluent method-like interface to the fields. Height and weight
are measured in meters and kilograms.

Example:

```ruby
2.2.2 (main):0 > result = _
=> ...
2.2.2 (main):0 > result.status
=> :married
2.2.2 (main):0 > result.biography.born_at
=> "New York City, New York"
2.2.2 (main):0 > result.biography.born_on
=> #<Date: 1984-11-22 ((2446027j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
2.2.2 (main):0 > result.biography.distinctive_features
=> [
  [0] "Her Lips",
  [1] "Husky Voice"
]
```

These examples (and this gem) use
[awesome_print](https://github.com/michaeldv/awesome_print) for better REPL
experience.
